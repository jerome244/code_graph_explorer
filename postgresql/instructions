If you want the “ORM model classes” / schema

Pick one (or more) of these:

Your real models are in your code: app/models.py + Django migrations in app/migrations/.

Generate models from an existing DB (reverse-engineer):

python manage.py inspectdb > models_from_db.py


See the SQL for a migration:

python manage.py sqlmigrate app_label 0001


Dump only the DB schema (Postgres):

pg_dump -h HOST -U USER -d DB_NAME -s > schema.sql


Explore schema in psql:

\dn          -- list schemas
\dt app_*    -- list tables (filter)
\d table     -- describe a table
